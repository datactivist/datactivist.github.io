        <div class="col-8"><p>The research in social science of Datactivist&rsquo;s founders entertained a belief that it is essential to <strong>put users at the centre of open data policies</strong>. In his <a href="http://www.theses.fr/2016ENST0045">doctoral dissertation</a>, Samuel Goëta showed that the datasets published on open data portals often come out of the logic of the offer: the administrations employees choose the datasets to be open and how they will be published without taking into account the users needs about data.</p>
<p>In his work on electoral sociology, Joël Gombin has experienced <strong>the limits of open data:</strong> : too aggregated, rarely updated, poorly documented, sometimes unusable. And, for administration employees, it’s a lot of work for datasets that are sometimes little used or not used.</p>
<p>It is our wish to <strong>put our expertise into data producers and reusers</strong>, that made us create Datactivist, to open data and make them used and useful.</p>
<p>The cooperative company quickly expanded to <strong>support organizations of all types</strong> (public sector, companies, NGOs) about the opening of their data, the uses and requests of open data.</p>
<p><strong>As an open data pure player</strong>, we help our customers through consulting activities ranging from the definition to the operational implementation of an open data strategy ; training that puts open data in the general context of the data revolution and data science ; and facilitation to help data reuse by experts and beginners.</p>

          <h3>We believe in open knowledge </h3>
          <p>Opening data, and more widely, the knowledge it is based on, can reduce information asymmetries and create a fair environment between all stakeholders. Open data enhances transparency of public policies, boosts innovation, and knocks down organisation walls. The data allow a common reference to set up, they empower reality: they are never neutral and can be activated to serve a goal. We want to allow everyone to manipulate data, without naivety, but without pessimism</p>

          <h3>We support those who create change</h3>
          <p>Data opening and use require considerable work, often invisible and not taken into account. We bring together the diversity of our skills, our expertise and our professionalism to help our private or public customers to achieve their ambition. To create change, journalists, NGOs, and digital facilitation stakeholders have a key role to grow the audience of data. </p>

          <p>YOLO: we only live once, the time we spend working must be as much useful, fulfilling and respectful  as possible, to find a balance between professional and personal life. At Datactivist, employees have a great independence in the way they plan their work and manage their working time. Information sharing and kindness are the rule. Presenteeism is not part of our values, we prefer efficiency. We also tend to 0 paper use, we use extensively collaborative work tools, and actively fight against meetings. The team operates in remote, distributed throughout France, mobile and as close as possible to our customers.</p>

Our status of cooperative and participatory society testifies that Datactivist is governed democratically by its employees in order to sustain our jobs and our business project. We apply ourselves to the principles we defend: Datactivist's work is freely reusable, as it is published under the Creative Commons BY-SA license. Finally, we launched the TeamOpenData community to gather professional stakeholders of open data, and we are developing an open source framework for data opening.</p>
